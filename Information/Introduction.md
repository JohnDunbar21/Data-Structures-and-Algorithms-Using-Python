# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures

A data structure is able to store and retrieve data.

### Data structures utilise the following functions:

- Input information
    - This is how data is recieved, and is determined by the structure in question. What information can be included? Where in the structure is the data inserted? Does this interact with existing data in the structure?
- Process information
    - This is how data is manipulated, and can either occur concurrently or as a result of other processes involved in a given data structure. This process is mainly concerned with how existing data needs to change to accomodate new, updated, or removed data.
- maintain information
    - This is how data is organised, and is determined by the nature of the relationship between data entities. In addition to this, it also looks at memory allocation to ensure the system operates optimally.
- retrieve information
    - This is how data is extracted from the structure, and primarily concerns itself with the processes involved in retrieving given data entities from a structure.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions that produce a given/desired output.

Algorithms are used to manipulate and process data. __Whilst data structures store data, algorithms are what manipulate and process data__.
